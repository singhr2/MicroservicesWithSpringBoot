# Unique name for the service (referred in Eureka Server)
#----------------------------------------------
# comma-separated-list
# Ideally same as the names of property files used on the backend
# But since - is used as separator between service and profile name
# hence avoided the same name in spring.cloud.config.name
#If I make the application-name to include _ instead of -,
# need to consider all changes where this name might be referred (e.g., WebSecurityConfigurationAdapter)
spring.application.name=users-ws


#==============================================
#    Config server related

# server.port from application.properties of config server
spring.cloud.config.uri=${CONFIG_URI:http://localhost:8012}


#service-id(spring.application.name) from config Service
# Ideally should eb the application-name but since - is used for separating with profile,
# try avoiding that.
